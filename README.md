# RecycleMe
# Overview
Finding recycling locations can be difficult. This is where RecycleMe can help. The purpose of this web application is for users to be able to find a location to recycle. This website is also a collaborative site meaning account holders will be able to add locations to the database if one is not already listed on the website.

The idea for this web application came about when I had old clothes that were not in good enough condition to donate. One could just throw these items away but it can take anywhere from 20 - 200 years for clothes to decompose. Rather than negatively impacting the enviornment, RecycleMe makes it easier to find a location for users to recycle. 

The purpose 

## Features
* **User Search:** Anyone will be able search for recycling locations to recycle. The search will then populate a list of locations based on the information entered by the user. This feature will not require an account.
* **User Accounts:** Users will be able to create an account to share locations that may not already be listed on the website
* **Account Holder can add a new location:** Users that have accounts with the site will be able to add unlisted recycling locations to the database.
## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* Java
* SpringBoot
* SQL
* Thymeleaf
* Javascript
### Necessary To Learn
For this project it will be necessary to get even more familiar with databases and learn how a user will be able to add information to a database that is already a part of the web application. It will also be necessary for me to become more familiar with front end development and how to make the website aesthetically pleasing to the user. I will also need to gain a deeper knowledge and understanding of how to use Bootstrap and implement a desired template into my project.

### What's Next
Eventually I would like to add a blog and tips component to the website. I would also like to add a feature where users are able to search for recycling locations that base one the specific type of item they would like to recycle like textiles or electronics.

### Project on YouTube
I have created a video of what my project looks like on youtube: https://youtu.be/sxxlsDGJTUU
